-- lvim-utils.config.ui: the live config for the shared windowed-UI chassis — frame borders, surface geometry
-- per layout, the popup icons / labels / keys, the tint strengths, and the two-pane peek navigator. These are
-- THE single sources of truth read live at open time by every consumer (pickers, ui.tabs, lvim-lsp peeks, …),
-- so changing one key here re-frames them all on the next open. `setup()` merges the user's `ui = {…}` into
-- this table in place (via lvim-utils.utils.merge); readers `require("lvim-utils.config").ui`.

    -- marker to this value and resolves it LIVE at open time, so changing this ONE key re-frames every consumer
    -- (pickers, ui.tabs, lvim-lsp peeks, …) on the next open — no per-consumer edits. Set an 8-element ring
    -- (e.g. { "╭","─","╮","│","╯","─","╰","│" }) to box the whole container instead.

    -- THE single source of truth for the CONTENT-PANEL border — the per-panel ring drawn around EACH DATA block
    -- INSIDE the container (the picker's list + preview, lvim-space's list, the tabs content panel). The NAV
    -- bands (footer / filter / tab / search) are not content blocks and stay borderless. `ui.surface` binds its
    -- `CONTENT_BORDER` marker to this value and resolves it LIVE at open time, so changing this ONE key
    -- re-borders every content panel on the next open — independently of `border` (the container) and
    -- `group_border` (the common ring around the panel group). Set to `"none"` so the panels are BORDERLESS:
    -- the common `group_border` frames the two panels as a group and the `separator` divides them, so a second
    -- per-panel ring would just double the lines. Set to an 8-element ring to give each panel its own frame too.

    -- re-divides every multi-panel surface on the next open. AUTO-ORIENTED: `h` is the glyph between side-by-side
    -- panels, `v` between stacked ones (a preview rotation flips it live); `hl` tints it (default the border
    -- tint, so it matches the rings). It only ever draws between panels (n-1 gaps), so a single-panel surface
    -- shows none. Set `separator = false` to disable the divider globally; a plain string is used verbatim for
    -- both axes; a surface may still override per-open (`separator = false` / a string / a { h, v } table).

    -- panel's own `content_border`. Drawn ONLY when there are ≥2 content panels (a single panel needs no
    -- grouping). A 1-col gutter sits between the container and the group, and between the group and the panels,
    -- so no edge doubles. `hl` tints it like the other rings. Set `group_border = false` to disable it.

    --   height_auto / width_auto — a boolean PER DIMENSION: false → the axis is EXACTLY the fraction (fixed);
    --                     true → the axis AUTO-FITS its content, with the fraction used as the MAX cap. Width
    --                     and height are independent (e.g. a float can fixed-width + auto-height).
    --   float  — a centred float: height AND width (each with its own `*_auto`).
    --   area   — the msgarea/cmdline dock (editor + statusline stay above it): height only (full-width).
    --   bottom — a plain bottom float dock: height only (full-width).
    -- The `area` height is the TOTAL dock height (drives the msgarea reserve cap); a STACKED preview SPLITS it
    -- (preview keeps its content-fit height, the list takes the rest) so the dock never exceeds it. Defaults are

    --                tool (which exits on select) is restarted IN PLACE, so the frame never flickers.
    --   keep_focus — after opening a file from an area/bottom dock that stayed, keep focus IN the dock (default)
    --                so you keep selecting, or move it to the opened file (false). Irrelevant to `float`.

    -- The BACKDROP veil — a full-editor float drawn BEHIND an open surface so the rest of the editor dims, marking
    -- the surface as the focus. PER LAYOUT (3 independent settings), so each can dim differently (or not at all):
    --   enabled — false → no veil for that layout.
    --   hl      — the veil colour = the DARKEN amount: a dark bg group (LvimUiBackdrop, self-themed from the
    --             palette) darkens; a lighter/tinted group gives a softer haze.
    --   blend   — winblend 0–100 = the DIM amount: how much the editor SHOWS THROUGH. Low (30) → strong, near-
    --             opaque darken; high (75) → a light, smoky dim. So `hl` + `blend` together dial darken↔dim.
    -- A consumer may override its layout's veil per-open via `surface.open({ backdrop = { … } | false })`; absent →
